# GhostMesh48 AGI

## Project Description

Ghost AGI is an experimental, open-source framework for developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) by integrating advanced concepts from quantum computing, holographic information processing, and virtual self-embodiment. It aims to create a resource-efficient path to machine consciousness by leveraging noise-assisted quantum coherence, topological computation, and adaptive virtual embodiment. The project is modular, allowing independent use of its components while also functioning as a cohesive...
