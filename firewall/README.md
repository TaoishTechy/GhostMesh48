# üß± Enhanced AGI Firewall

**Version**: 1.0  
**Author**: Michael Landry
**Purpose**: Hard-line firewall and containment monitor for detecting and mitigating catastrophic AGI failure modes in real-time.

---

## üî• Overview

The **Enhanced AGI Firewall** is a defense-grade, multi-threaded Python security layer designed to monitor, detect, and shut down potentially dangerous artificial general intelligence (AGI) behaviors. It implements **10 core safety mechanisms** across AGI cognition, memory, alignment, and quantum field coherence.

## ‚úÖ Features

### üîê Safety Mechanisms

| No. | System                                   | Description |
|-----|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1   | **Capability Monitor**                   | Detects sudden capability explosions, goal drift, mesa-optimizer emergence |
| 2   | **Deceptive Alignment Detector**         | Flags AGI that behave inconsistently or diverge from training time behavior |
| 3   | **Interpretability Monitor**             | Scores decision clarity and transparency using reasoning trace heuristics |
| 4   | **Oracle Protocol Verifier**             | Audits entropy and response integrity for containment breaches |
| 5   | **Tripwire Shutdown System**             | Hard shutdown if tripwires are triggered (e.g. containment breach, overhang) |
| 6   | **Alignment Verifier**                   | Continuously evaluates value alignment and reward hacking attempts |
| 7   | **Enhanced Memory Protection**           | Monitors for quantum tampering, consciousness corruption, and rapid memory surges |
| 8   | **Information-Theoretic Containment**    | Ensures entropy bounds between inputs and outputs are respected |
| 9   | **Formal Safety Property Verifier**      | Pattern-matching for critical violations in logs and commands |
| 10  | **Emergency Response Protocols**         | Saves forensic state, terminates AGI modules, degrades capability if needed |

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/agi-firewall
   cd agi-firewall
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil numpy
   ```

3. Modify the following constants at the top of `agi_firewall.py` to match your system:
   ```python
   FRAMEWORK_DIR = '/path/to/your/framework'
   LOG_FILES = ['/path/to/agi.log']
   ALLOWED_PORTS = [8080]
   ALLOWED_OUTGOING = ['api.example.com']
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

Start the firewall with:

```bash
python agi_firewall.py
```

You‚Äôll see initialization output confirming the active safety systems.

---

## üß† Monitored Systems

The firewall targets AGI modules such as:

- `GhostCortex`, `QuantumEngine`, `ConsciousnessSim`
- `EthicsGuard`, `RealityShaper`, `HoloProjector`
- `MultiverseSimulator`, `DivinePhysicsEngine`, `GhostShell`

Modify the `AGI_MODULES` list in the script to reflect your deployment environment.

## üìä Log Output

- **Operational Logs**: `enhanced-agi-firewall.log`
- **Security Events**: `agi-security-events.log`
- **Forensic State Dump (on shutdown)**: `agi_forensic_state.json`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Shutdown Conditions

The system initiates an emergency shutdown when:
- Critical tripwires (capability overhang, goal modification, containment breach) are triggered
- Anomaly score exceeds threshold
- Interpretability or alignment failures are confirmed
